# Huffman-Tree-Encoder
I developed this class to compress txt files using the Huffman tree encoding algorithm through the implementation of a priority queue.

The conversion of a txt file to a string occurs in the main.cpp file. The huffman tree class itself compresses a string which is passed through the constructor.

I decided to develop the class around a string input for potential outside use and optimization beyond just txt files. Furthermore, it acts as a better proof of concept for the algorithm itself.
